# Classification Algorithms Showcase

Welcome to the Classification Algorithms Showcase project! This repository serves as a collection of various classification algorithms implemented in Python. Whether you're a machine learning enthusiast or a practitioner, this project aims to provide a hands-on experience with popular classification algorithms.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to showcase the implementation of various classification algorithms. I previously attempted this project with a more messy and inexperienced approach. Now armed with new knowledge and skills, I am revisiting this project to provide a cleaner and more organized implementation of different classification algorithms.


Feel free to explore the implemented algorithms, use them in your projects, etc...
## Implemented Algorithms

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)


### Decision Tree

### Random Forest


### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Resch-Gabriel-Z/classification-algorithms-showcase.git
    cd classification-algorithms-showcase
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
